# oF CLion 2016

This is a blank openFrameworks project that compile and runs on CLion (good bye XCode).
It works with oF 0.9.4, CLion 2016 and OS Sierra.

## Setup: 
- Clone this repo and import the folder into CLion.
- Change Line 8 of `CMakeLists.txt` with your OF path.
- Setup the executable on `Run > Edit Configurations`.
- Profit!!!
